    <h2>
        Hi! I'm Joey Shearer
    </h2>
        <br>
    <p> I'm a photographer and graphic designer who has many years of experience. I started with video but I mainly focus on still images. My love for the craft originated why I got a copy of photoshop CS1 for my 8th birthday. While it was already old at the time, I enjoyed editing pictures. I even made the yearbook cover for my 5th grade yearbook!</p>
